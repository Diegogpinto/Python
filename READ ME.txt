/*****************************************************************************\
DOI Program: 9-25-2015

This program was designed with the idea that all sourceof information from a book or an article will be collected
and stored in such a format where it would be easily accessable through a webpage. The program will read a text
a text file "bib.txt" where it will contain some information about a book with the following commands which give
information: \\A,\\B,\\J,\\Y,\\R,\\P.

All commands are in a global dictionary for this code. it was not necessary to contain it into a method since 
this is a small program with small functionality.

The output of the program will remove all trailing blanks, all unwanted characters, notify of ending 
information with </doi>.

Contains a small error checking when a command is unknown.


/*****************************************************************************\
Database Program: 9-10-2015

This program is to illstarte a usage for dictionaries in python. the program will first boot and 
set up a dictionary with the given information from a text file called "fl_cities.txt" 
seperated by a ";" character. the city will become the key and the zip code will become the value for the key.

Next, the program will read line by line the "fl_maint.txt" file which has a series of commands to be executed.
It will either change, remove, display, or update the list.

The program has a small level of error checking since there is no user input. 

/*****************************************************************************\
Prime Number finder: 9-09-2015 

This program is used to show some manipulation and usage of an array list in python.This program asks the user
to insert a value between 2-300. any value smaller or greater than that will be checked as an error and will 
looped until the user inputs a number between the range. The program uses eval() which will evalutate what the
input from the user was and will determine if it was an interger value. 

After the initial stage, the program will populate with numbers up to the user number and iterate itself check if
the current number (starting at 2) is a prime number of the user not.this process will continue until the upper
boundary that is user defined is hit.

The output will display the list of prime numbers with 5 spaces, 6 per row.

/*****************************************************************************\
Fibinnacci Sequence: 9-03-2015 

This program will output the Fib sequence up to the Nth term which the user selects. There is no error checking
on this particular code. 

The output will result in a list of Fib numbers seperated by 6 spaces.


/*****************************************************************************\
Converion Program: 8-19-2015 

Small program with a simple feature to use manipulation of data and usage of input in the python language. 
Contains example for math, output, input, and the eval() function. 

Asks a user for a temperature in farhenhiet.

the output will be the result after using a formula for conversion to Celsious.
